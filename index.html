          Hello There! <br />
          My name is Solomon Avraham, I'm currently a student at Tech-Carrer, to
          become a Full Stack Developer. Y'all more then welcome to be a part of
          my journey to the Tech's world.
        </p>

        <p id="main-p-2">
          A little background, I was born in Kiryat Shmona, Israel. I’m 30 years
          old, living in Hedera. I'd been working in the warehouse industry for
          most of my working life. That was a very teaching experience, in all
          aspects. but I felt No desire to work in this industry no more. my
          search for a new occupation/studies took many years, it was kinda
          common in my environment. and time does fly, believe that. Thank to my
          past, I realized FSD is where I belong. I am glad I decided to study
          at Tech Carrer.
        </p>

        <p id="main-p-3">
          I graduated from Beit-Shmuel, a yeshiva for high-school students.
          Afterward, I joined to serve in IDF, and finished my service after one
          year, as a result of discrepancy in the system. In my free time, I
          love to play basketball, boxing, listen to music, and read from time
          to time.
        </p>
        <p id="main-p-4">
          For the last 6 years I'm leading and mange my basketball team, “
          Yeidersall-Hadera”, we part of a league called “LBI”(Beta-Israel's
          league). a basketball's league with the purpose of social network and
          involvement in the Ethiopian community. The league has 16 teams around
          the country, from Krait Haim to Kriat Gat.
          <span id="projects">LBI</span> is a great platform to develop the
          community!

              My first HTML project introduced me to the world of programming.it
              was really fun. my love for Ethiopian food has given me the niche
              for this project. I really loved the outcome.

            <p>
              making a piano seems like an easy job to handle. I gotta admit, it
              was indeed easy! lol, looking forward to learning Javascript where
              I can male scripts.
